# Computer generated skeletal and muscle animations for posture training

## Description

This project was development as a part of my dissertation for my Computer Science Masters course in Trinity College Dublin (TCD) for the year 2022-23. This project aims to provide a solution to virtual real-time posture assessment and training using two methods:

1. Virtual Reality
2. On-Screen Implementation (MediaPipe)

This project incorporates the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) posture assessment technique along with a 3D pose matching algorithm (Euclidean metric) for fullfilling the goal.


## Software Requirements

Software: Unity 2021.3.17f1 (OnScreen) or 2021.3.27f1 (Virtual Reality)

*Note: The version of unity should not make a huge difference in the projects.*

## Hardware Requirements

#### Onscreen Implementation
1. **Operating System**: Windows 11 Home
2. **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with Radeon Graphics 3.20 GHz
3. **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU
4. **RAM**: 16 GB

#### Virtual Reality Implementation

1. Oculus Meta Quest 2
